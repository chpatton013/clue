        <h3>Design Overview:</h3>
        <p>
            <p>
                The framework of the Indication game is broken into several layers, 
                Client(human player) classes, Server classes, Common classes, and Messaging classes.
            </p>
            <h5>Client Layer</h5>
            <p>
                The client layer of the framework has a finite number of states.  Each State class
                extends the base State class.  The base State class extends the java.util.Observable class.
                Classes that extend the base State class will also become an observable model.
                The ClientController class acts as facilitator in changing client States, handling
                network communications, and provides hooks for GUIs or console applications.
                The ClientController is the gateway for all external activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this implementation there are two objects that interact with the ClientController:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. ClientNetwork - uses methods react (from network) and send (to network)</li>
                    <li>2. GUI - uses methods use (from GUI) and prompt (to GUI)</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                The ClientNetwork class is an implementation of OCSF's AbstractClient 
                interface that handles the networking layer between our controller and the server. 
                Incoming network activity is passed on to the controller (via react), 
                and any actions by the controller that require network activity 
                are passed to this handler (via send).
            </p>
            <p>
                The GUI class relays user actions to the controller to elicit modifications 
                to the current State (via use). The controller also sends signals to the GUI (via prompt) 
                to extract desired user input. Because the GUI is an Observer of the current State, 
                it can update any time the State is modified.
            </p>
            
            Design of Game States:
            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                    <td>ClientMenuState</td> 
                    <td>The first State the client enters.  The State has options for single player game, multi player game, options, instructions.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ClientLobbyState</td> 
                    <td>Client is searching for or creating games on a server.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ClientPreGameState</td>
                    <td>Other players can join and you can add robot players. Landing State for single player games.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ClientGameState</td>
                    <td>Client receives this State from the game server and client reacts to the Game State.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h5>Server Layer</h5>
            <p>
                From the perspective of the server, the game can be in two states.  
                One a game can be in preparation(waiting for players), and second a game can be in play.
                The ServerController is controlling every game being played. 
                Each game has a set of players connected to it, represented by the OCSF ConnectionToClient object. 
                We track this association with a map of ConnectionToClient to Game.
                This implies that multiple ConnectionToClient keys will point to the same Game value (many people per game).  
                The ConnectionToClient is also associated with ServerPlayers via a map (ServerPlayer to ConnectionToClient).   
                The PlayerId of these ServerPlayers is the same as that of the ClientPlayers on the client side.
                There is also another map from ServerPlayer to AI. 
                In the event that a player drops out (the Connection becomes invalid), we will defer to the AI routine to play for the player. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Server's representation of a game is absolute: the player order, draw pile, discard pile, destination map, 
                and solution are kept in it(ClientGameStates only know of the player order, the size of the draw pile, and the destination map).
                The ServerController class is primarily composed of functions to facilitate playing for the AI characters and functions acting 
                as a switchboard for Client interaction. The ServerNetwork class (which implements OCSF's AbstractServer interface) handles 
                network requests from its Clients (via receive) and sends responses off to them (via send).
            </p>
            
            <h5>Common Layer</h5>
            <p>
                There are "common" components to both the Client, Server, and messaging layers.
                The common classes are designed based on elements and rules of the Indication game.  
                The common components also includes data and an interface for Player objects.  
                All layers are dependent on the classes in the common layer.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of a common component would be the Card class.  The Card class is used 
                by the server layer's Game class.  The Game class maintains a draw pile and discard pile composed
                of Card Objects.  The server layer passes serialized card Objects, via the messaging layer, to 
                the Client layer.  Players on the client layer use the Card objects to reveal information about the solution of
                the game.  The player on the client layer can then play a Card Object, by sending a serialized request, via the messaging 
                layer, to the game layer.
            </p>
            
            <h5>Messaging Layer</h5>
            <p>
                The messaging layer is composed of classes that contain various attributes.  The attributes are requested by the client
                and provide by the server layer.  Messaging layer instances are serialized and sent as generic Objects.  When the client or server receives 
                a message layer object, the object is de-serialized and casted back to the appropriate class.  
                The client messaging classes are typically small classes.  The client classes simply
                prompt the server to respond with data that is needed for a particular client state.  The server messaging classes
                are used to respond back to the client(s) and typically have more attributes.  The response can be sent to one or many clients, 
                and requires that clients handle the response message appropriately. (ie. The client should cast the Object back to its correct 
                class instance and take the correct logical steps, based on the response type, to update the client game state.)
